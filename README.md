# AmazonScrapper
In this project, we aim to scrape and analyze data for a specific product category from Amazon. The code provided enables us to extract information such as product descriptions, prices, ratings, review counts, and URLs for the desired product category. The extracted data is then saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
