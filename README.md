Amazon Product Data Scraper and Analyzer
This project aims to scrape and analyze data for a specific product category from Amazon. It provides a Python-based web scraping script that extracts information such as product descriptions, prices, ratings, review counts, and URLs for the desired product category. The extracted data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

Features
Web Scraping: Utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from Amazon. The code uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML structure of the search results page and extract relevant information for each product item.

Data Extraction: The extract_record function is responsible for extracting the desired information from each product item. It navigates the HTML structure to extract the product description and URL. It also retrieves the price, rating, and review count, taking into account any error-handling scenarios where certain information may not be available.

Data Processing: The search_query function serves as the main routine of the program. It sets up the Chrome web driver, performs the search query on Amazon, and iterates through the search result pages to extract data for each product item. The extracted data is stored in a list called records.

Data Storage: Once all the data is extracted, it is saved to a CSV file. The code creates a CSV writer and writes the extracted records to the file. The resulting CSV file contains columns for the product description, price, rating, review count, and URL.

Data Analysis and Visualization: The extracted data can be further analyzed using pandas and other data analysis libraries. Tasks such as calculating average prices, identifying products with the highest ratings, filtering data, sorting data, and creating visualizations can be performed to gain insights and explore trends within the specific product category.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the code files.

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install the necessary libraries, including Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium.

Adjust the Chrome driver path in the code to match your system configuration. Replace the path in the webdriver.Chrome() call with the appropriate path to the Chrome driver executable.

Modify the code to specify the desired product category by updating the search term in the search_query function. For example, change search_query('laptop') to search_query('smartphone') to scrape data for smartphones.

Run the script by executing python scrape_data.py. The script will start scraping data from Amazon and store the extracted data in a CSV file named after the search term.

Perform data analysis and exploration on the extracted data using pandas or other data analysis tools. You can modify the code to suit your specific analysis needs, such as calculating statistics, creating visualizations, or conducting further research.
